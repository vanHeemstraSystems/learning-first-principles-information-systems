**Elon: Reasoning from First Principles (Software Development Perspective)** 

- “Physics teaches you to reason from first principles rather than by analogy”
- Applied to software: Breaking free from conventional limitations in architecture and algorithms

## 🎓 **Specific Training**

While most training focuses on general architecture, the key is to apply the First Principles **methodology** they teach. Look for courses that emphasize:

- **Questioning assumptions** about architecture patterns
- **Understanding trade-offs** at a fundamental level (not just “use this pattern”)
- **CAP theorem, fallacies of distributed computing** - these ARE first principles

## 🎯 **Key Thought Leaders on First Principles**

**Addy Osmani**  - Engineering Manager at Google, writes extensively on first principles for developers

**Eric Scrivner - Software Process From First Principles** 

- <https://ericscrivner.me/2017/06/software-process-first-principles/>
- Identifies four fundamental concerns: Memory augmentation, Uniting fragmented knowledge, Risk mitigation, Handling changing requirements

The **fundamental difference** from general architecture resources:

**First Principles resources teach you to:**

1. Question WHY patterns exist (not just WHAT they are)
1. Break down to fundamental truths (CAP theorem, network physics, data consistency requirements)
1. Build solutions from ground up based on YOUR specific constraints
1. Challenge “best practices” when they don’t apply to your context

**NOT:**

- Following architectural patterns because they’re popular
- Reasoning by analogy (“Google does it this way, so should we”)
- Collecting architectural pattern catalogs

The best approach is to **combine** general architecture knowledge with First Principles thinking methodology - use resources like Fundamentals of Software Architecture to learn patterns, but apply First Principles thinking (from the resources above) to decide WHEN and WHY to use them.
